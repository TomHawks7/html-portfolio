<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Young man, who boredom easily but like many things. I like those contrast, i love the nature : My first dream job was to be a Rancher, a cow boy and living in the nature with my horses.
  And i like the automobil and bikes, i spent times behind a steerwheel or an Handlebar, 20 thousand kilometers by year just for the pleasure.
  the only similitude is the journey.
</p>

<p>I'm not a lazy person. I stopped school at the end of highschool, and i work every year since my 18. I have two objective in my life.
  Taking pleasure and living peacefuly ! ( far from stupid people if it's possible) if i have to work in something i dont like, no problem. If i can buy something i like.
Simple thought give simple thing and the life is easier. Far be it from me to not be ambitious, of course. 
My objective today is to leave in america, and why not, becoming an american. </p>
